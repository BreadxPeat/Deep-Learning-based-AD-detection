**Introduction to the Problem Statement**

In our endeavor to address the challenge of early Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection, we are planning to leverage the power of deep learning on MRI images. In this project, we aim to design a robust predictive model, and our approach involves utilizing the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset.

**Plan of Action**

We plan to curate a comprehensive dataset from ADNI, encompassing MRI scans from individuals with confirmed Alzheimer's diagnoses and healthy controls. To enhance feature extraction, we will be standardizing MRI images through preprocessing steps such as _skull stripping_, normalization, and image registration.
